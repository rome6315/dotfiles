SET UP:
- Make dotfiles dir in ~/dotfiles/ 
- Make .config fir in ~/dotfiles/.config/ 
- Move wanted config directories to ~/dotfiles/.config/ (i.e. mv ~/.config/zsh ~/dotfiles/config)
- Type 'stow .' in ~/dotfiles dir 
	- this will create a symlink so that your zsh config directory goes back to ~/.config/zsh while
	also staying in ~/dotfiles/.config dir
	- on top of that, either file can be edited and both will update themeselves to stay in sync

STOW IGNORE FILE:
- The local stow ignore file works the exact same as a .gitignore file. use it for stuff you dont want to
create a symlink for, but want it in the ~/dotfiles dir
- make sure to copy the default ignore file found in their docs and add onto it because this default file
will ignore stuff like .gitignore and .git which you want

MAINTENANCE:
- anytime you download something new like a Window Manager or whatever that has a new config you want to 
track, follow the steps in "SET UP:" above

MOVING TO NEW SYSTEM:
- create the ~/dotfiles dir on the new system
- link it to the existing git repo and then pull down the contents of the repo
- type 'stow .' and it will create all of the subfolders you have in the .config directory using symlinks
- boom new system has all important config files immediately

TIPS:
- this can be done with anything, not just dotfiles. For example, you can also stow your .local/bin dir
or you .themes dir
